"""
This is an example code to be included as supplementary material to the following article: 
"AutoHood3D: A Multi-Modal Benchmark for Automotive Hood Design and Fluidâ€“Structure Interaction".

This is a demonstration intended to provide a working example with data provided in the repo.
For application on other datasets, the requirement is to configure the settings. 

Dependencies: 
    - Python package list provided: package.list

Running the code: 
    - assuming above dependencies are configured, "python <this_file.py>" will run the demo code. 
    NOTE - It is important to check README prior to running this code.
